# THI MAIL RELAY

THI only allows SMTP from VPN (meanwhile IMAP, TCP 993, is also only acceptablie via VPN)  
Here is the `containerized` fix for the problem...

## Why

No need to stay fulltime on VPN, maybe somebody else can do for me...

## NO GUI is Better

[openfortivpn](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn) is used here, no need for GUIs, so just use this

## Resolv Conf

Ã¤h whut...  
need some other DNS set exta? No way, should be server provided

## BUILD

```bash
docker build -t openforti-tcp-relay:latest .
```

## RUN

```bash
docker run --rm -p 1587:587 -v $PWD/.conf:/tmp/conf --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device=/dev/ppp openforti-tcp-relay:latest
```
